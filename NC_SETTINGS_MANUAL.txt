note: ALL UNITS IN MILLIMETERS!
note: machine should be zeroed AT THE TOP OF THE WASTEBOARD, not at the top of the part

** Possible options: **

Rectangle, Ellipse, and Contour:

Required values:

partDepth - the thickness of the part

retractHeight - the height to retract to when not cutting through the part and just repositioning tool

bitOut - boolean parameter: true when the bit is outside the contour and cutting around the part, false when cutting on the inside.
For example, a pocket within a part would be bitOut = False, since the bit is cutting on the inside.

bitDiam - the diameter of the bit

feedRate - the speed to move at when cutting sideways

plungeRate - the speed to move at when plunging directly down into the part

spindleSpeed - the speed of the drill in revolutions per minute

Optional values:

passes - the number of times the tool follows the contour, each time getting a little bit deeper. The default is 1, though note that in 
most cases this should be modified to be larger, such that the maximum amount the tool is cutting is less than 40% of the tool diameter. 
For example, if the part is 6.35mm, and the bit is 5mm, it would be safe to do 4 passes

spiral - boolean parameter: when True, the bit will spiral down into the part instead of going down in steps. Default is false.

finalPassDepth - The amount to cut on the final pass. The final pass is in addition to the number of passes, and is to ensure a clean
finish. If spiral is True, a final pass will happen to ensure cutting all the way through the part. Otherwise, if finalPassDepth is left
at the default value of zero, no final pass will happen.

extraDepth - The amount to pierce through the wasteboard past the bottom of the part. This should remain at the default of 0.002 mils or 0.05 mm

direction - The direction of the spindle's rotation. 1 is clockwise, -1 is counterclockwise. Default is clockwise.

HolePath:

Required values:

retractHeight - the height to return to after making a hole in the part

plungeRate - the speed in mm per minute when moving down into the part to make a hole

spindleSpeed - the speed of the spindle

Optional values:

extraDepth:  The amount to pierce through the wasteboard past the bottom of the part. This should remain at the default of 0.002 mils or 0.05 mm

direction - The direction of the spindle's rotation. 1 is clockwise, -1 is counterclockwise. Default is clockwise.
